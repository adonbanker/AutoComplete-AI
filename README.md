# AutoComplete-AI
# 🔮 Next Word Predictor with NLP & Deep Learning

A deep learning-based **Next Word Prediction** model built using TensorFlow and NLP techniques. This project predicts the next word in a sentence based on previous context — just like autocomplete in messaging apps or search engines.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **deep learning (LSTM)** to build a text generation model that can predict the **next likely word** in a sequence of words.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras 🤖
- NumPy
- NLTK / SpaCy (for preprocessing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA and visualization)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Text Corpus**: Loaded a large text dataset as training data.
2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing special characters and punctuation
3. **Sequence Generation**:
   - Converted text into sequences of N words (e.g., "I love deep learning")
   - Each sequence used to train the model to predict the next word
4. **Model Architecture**:
   - Embedding Layer
   - LSTM / GRU Layer
   - Dense Output Layer with Softmax
5. **Training**:
   - Categorical Crossentropy Loss
   - Adam Optimizer
   - Accuracy tracked per epoch
6. **Prediction**:
   - Input: a few words
   - Output: predicted next word

## 📈 Results

- ✅ Model trained with good accuracy on sentence continuation tasks
- ✅ Predicts next word in a sequence with fair contextual relevance
- ✅ Can be extended to generate full sentences or paragraphs

## 🚀 Example Output

**Input**: `"The future of AI"`

**Predicted next word**: `"is"`

```python
Input Sequence: "Deep learning is"
→ Prediction: "amazing"
